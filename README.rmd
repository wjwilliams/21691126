# Purpose

This is the final README, it is a compilation of all the questions.


```{r}

rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:
gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.

#NB load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

#Loading all the code from all 5 locations, this enables me to use all the functions that I have created for all of the seperate Questions
list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
list.files('Question1/code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
list.files('Question2/code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))

list.files('Question4/code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
